# Request Data:
Right now the program utilizes the terminal, however this can be easily changed to reading it in from a text file or something else. The user will enter 3 or 4 items. The first one is a number representing the task that they want to complete (1 for retrieving a link, 2 for adding a new link, or 3 for editing a current link). This is currently broken up into two steps the task, and then the data criteria.

# Receive Data:
Once the program receives the information, it completes the necessary steps that correspond to the selected task. It then returns a link if that is what the user requested, or the number 0 to indicate that the task was successfully completed. This can also be changed to fit the overall programs needs.
